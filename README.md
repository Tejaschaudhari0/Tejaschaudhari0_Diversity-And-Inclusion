# Diversity-And-Inclusion
This project analyzes hiring, promotion, turnover, and performance trends to identify gender imbalances and retention challenges. Key findings include a gender gap at senior and executive levels, lower female promotion rates, and a correlation between lower performance and higher turnover. The project offers recommendations to improve gender diversity, support performance development for women, reduce turnover, and enhance succession planning for senior roles.
